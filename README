Instructional Resource Information System (Service, Site)

The Instructional Resource Information Service project is a multi-phase development project that aims to integrate, organize and better utilize the substantial, but often disparate information resources within ISS.  The IRIS project will develop an agile framework for acquiring, modifying and accessing these information resources.

Beginning with the "Classroom Database", we will develop a framework and supporting policies for consistent data acquisition, documentation, and display.  The framework will be able to account for different individual's roles (beyond logged in, not logged in) and present information appropriate to the individual user.

- Accessibility
- Mobile platform
- Standards compliant

Having this information in a consistent form will allow us to be much more efficient with regards to sharing the information with one another and with our constituents.

ANNOUNCEMENT MESSAGE

We are excited to announce the upcoming rollout of the new Classroom Database web site. The new version of the Classroom Database achieves several goals:

 - it is a system with the potentioal to scale across campus and beyond,
-  it has been built as an application that works well with mobile devices, leverages geo-location data and utilizes modern web standards,
-  it provides more accurate data, aligned with central resources used by the Registrar's Office and the Space Survey initiative.

There are some features in the Classroom Database that we have, by popular demand, also retained. So you will find pictures and the 360degree views of rooms and we still will require kerberos authentication. In response to our redesign forums we've added improved search ability by room attributes and an map view for building and room location

We are excited to launch this new version with you!
